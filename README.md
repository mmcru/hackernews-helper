firefox addon that checks if the current page has been submitted to news.ycombinator.com

there are a couple features so far:

if the current page has not been submitted, the button will create a submission link (with title and url of the page)

if the current page has been submitted, the button badge shows the number of submissions from that url.

if there are submissions and the button is clicked, the user can page through submissions from that url, sorted by most recent or by most comments.
